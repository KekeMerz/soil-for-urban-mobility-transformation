# Definition of targets and constraints in Japan and Germany 
In a literature analysis, both targets and constraints for the UMT are identified via published strategies in mobility and transformation strategies as well as global contracts (e.g. Paris Agreement of the UN COP21). This includes a comparison of the applied sustainability definitions (e.g. social, ecological, economical). The analysis will lead to a first overview of status quo and will be further expanded in the course of the study.

# Local interviews and workshops
To close the research gap, interviews and workshops with stakeholders are planned as part of the Fellowship to identify targets and constraints for the UMT. Stakeholders from multiple disciplines are involved with different capacities in the UMT, including in A) governance, B) operation and C) society, where country-specific differences become obvious. A) Governance examples include that the Japanese law demands the availability of a parking spot at vehicle registration while Germany tolerates parking in public space. In Germany, the police is mostly focused on reactionary measured on traffic violations, e.g. check for speed limits and coordination at crash sites; in Japan, the unique system of Koban (police boxes) and Chuzaisho (residential police boxes) allows for a close-meshed integration into the community where police officers explicitly take over tasks of promoting ”safe and secure urban planning” that includes landscaping [1, p.15], a job that is typically done by traffic engineers in Germany. B) Operational differences include the level of privatisation of the public transport network (Japan high, Germany lower) as well as subsidies for public transport (Japan lower than Germany). C) Society in Germany accompanies most, if not all, modern mobility projects with protests and demonstrations from the renovation of train stations to the removal of individual parking lots. While Japan does not lack protests against mobility projects, the demonstrations are less spread and protests take different forms. Expert interviews with stakeholders from the correspinding fields will be conducted for Germany before the stay in Japan and then compared to the interviews administered in Japan.

# Analysis and recommendation 
In a comparative case study, the identified targets and constraints are analysed regarding their impact in Japan and Germany. Following, recommendations are formulated on how to ensure successful choice and implementation of measures for the UMT.
