    "text": "Welcome at the Fertile-soil research project which is planned by Keke Merz to be executed in Germany and Japan.\n\n1 Context\nThe recent heat wave in 2025 in Japan with repeatedly new temperature records makes it clear that climate adaption measures must be broadly introduced to help dampen the threats from climate change. Here, the sector of transport plays a major role with its high emissions (CO2, NOx, noise) and integral impact of the shape, streets and citizen health in our cities. The ongoing urban mobility transformation (UMT) re-envisions the street space not only as transitional space but as public space for human activity. Cities like Paris show that such a change is possible: Paris improved its air quality and quality of live focusing on multi-modal modes (cycling, walking, strong public transport) by extending cycling infrastructure and bike sharing [3]. So how can these transformation be achieved with high accepatability by politics and the public? Which goals are actually targeted and which constraints need to be considered? Transformational approaches must be country- and city-specific, considering local rules, laws, habits, and history (localisation). To plant best practises, we must first understand the ”soil”, meaning the specific targets and constraints of a city and country. With this knowledge, we can build robust and adaptable frameworks and choose fitting methods for the urban transformation to be implemented (see Figure ?@fig-methodology). Comparisons between countries are an especially suited method to uncover differences and similarities which might otherwise stay invisible as status quo [2].\n#Objective\nThe objective of this study is to compile an academic overview on the similarities and differences of targets and constraints for the urban mobility transition in Japan and Germany. Depending on data availability, specific regions will be targeted, e.g., Munich and (a district of) Tokyo.\n#Research question\nThe central research question that is to be tackled in this study is: What are context-specific differences and similarities in targets and constraints that influence the possible adaption of best practises in the UMT context towards climate change adaption with the exam\u0002ples of Japan and Germany?\n\n\n2 Contribution\nThe contribution of this study to the research area will fill the gap of understanding local conditions in the written academic discourse and will lead to deeper insights on how the local context affect the success and suitability of climate adaption measures in UMT (e.g., improving cycling infrastructure).\n\n\n\n\nCopyright© 2025 Keke P.

    "text": "Figure 1: Methdology overview of this research project\n\n\n\n\n1 Definition of targets and constraints in Japan and Germany\nIn a literature analysis, both targets and constraints for the UMT are identified via published strategies in mobility and transformation strategies as well as global contracts (e.g. Paris Agreement of the UN COP21). This includes a comparison of the applied sustainability definitions (e.g. social, ecological, economical). The analysis will lead to a first overview of status quo and will be further expanded in the course of the study.\n\n\n2 Local interviews and workshops\nTo close the research gap, interviews and workshops with stakeholders are planned as part of the Fellowship to identify targets and constraints for the UMT. Stakeholders from multiple disciplines are involved with different capacities in the UMT, including in A) governance, B) operation and C) society, where country-specific differences become obvious.\n\nGovernance examples include that the Japanese law demands the availability of a parking spot at vehicle registration while Germany tolerates parking in public space. In Germany, the police is mostly focused on reactionary measured on traffic violations, e.g. check for speed limits and coordination at crash sites; in Japan, the unique system of Koban (police boxes) and Chuzaisho (residential police boxes) allows for a close-meshed integration into the community where police officers explicitly take over tasks of promoting ”safe and secure urban planning” that includes landscaping [1, p.15], a job that is typically done by traffic engineers in Germany.\nOperational differences include the level of privatisation of the public transport network (Japan high, Germany lower) as well as subsidies for public transport (Japan lower than Germany).\nSociety in Germany accompanies most, if not all, modern mobility projects with protests and demonstrations from the renovation of train stations to the removal of individual parking lots. While Japan does not lack protests against mobility projects, the demonstrations are less spread and protests take different forms. Expert interviews with stakeholders from the correspinding fields will be conducted for Germany before the stay in Japan and then compared to the interviews administered in Japan.\n\n\n\n3 Analysis and recommendation\nIn a comparative case study, the identified targets and constraints are analysed regarding their impact in Japan and Germany. Following, recommendations are formulated on how to ensure successful choice and implementation of measures for the UMT.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright© 2025 Keke P. Merz",
