# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Polycrisis in cities world-wide: increasing natural catastrophe, changes in population size and age distribution (...) The sector of transport plays a major role after energy generation, Japan and Germany are no exception here: Transport is contributing 19% respectively 23% to the countriesâ€™ total CO2 emissions (...) Effects of transport beyond CO2 emissions include immense health impacts, public space usage, maintenance cost, transport (in-)equality (...). Cities like Amsterdam show that change is possible: Amsterdam moved from car-centric design and urban planning in the 1970s to the capital of the now famously bicycle-friendly Netherlands. Paris improved its air quality and quality of live focusing on multi-modal modes like cycling and walking in combination with a strong public transport by extending cycling infrastructure, bike sharing (...) The questions is how to achieve a transformation in cities? How do we ensure a high acceptability of the measure by politics and the public? Which goals do we actually target and which constraints need to be considered? Here, it becomes clear that the transformational approaches are and must be country- and city-specific with context-specific rules, laws, habits, and history. We want to know how best practices can be implemented world-wide. For this, we need to understand the soil in which the best practices must be planted, meaning the specific situation of a city/country. When we know which soil we have (meaning which target and constraints an area has), we can build robust and adaptable frameworks and choose fitting methods for the urban transformation to be implemented. Comparisons between countries are an especially suited method to uncover differences and similarities which might otherwise stay invisible as status quo.
